Thank you for playing 'Manifest'

This is a game about keen observation and spotting things.

You work as a security officer boarding passengers to the
interstellar spaceship Fracti.

Today the system has been hacked and manual passenger processing
is required.

You need to board, reject, or arrest as many passengers as you 
can before the gate closes and your shift ends.

Passengers with implant data that exactly matches the manifest 
record should be boarded.

Passengers with an entire field that is totally different should
be rejected.

Passengers acting suspiciously (there are clues in what they say
or do) will have an almost undetectable error in their implant 
data. Look out for a single digit difference in any field
except the dna fingerprint which will have a few more.
These are agents of the group that has hacked the Fracti and
must be caught!

Best of luck!
