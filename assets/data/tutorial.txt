Thank you for playing 'Manifest'

You work as a security officer boarding passengers to the
interstellar spaceship Fracti.

Your job is to check passengers implant data and confirm it
matches the ships manifest data, before they can board.

Today the system has been hacked and manual passenger processing
is required.

You need to correctly board, reject, or arrest as many passengers
as you can before the gate closes and your shift ends.

Only passengers with implant data that exactly matches the
ship manifest record should be boarded.

Passengers with an entire field that is totally different should
be rejected.

Passengers acting suspiciously (there are clues in what they say
or do) will have an almost undetectable error in their implant 
data. Look out for a single character difference in any field
except the dna fingerprint which will have a few more.
These are agents of the group that has hacked the Fracti and
must be caught!

Best of luck!
